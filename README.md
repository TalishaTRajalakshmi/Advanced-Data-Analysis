**Online Sales Analysis**

**1. Defining The Problem:**
The objective is to analyze online sales data to boost growth, improve customer retention, and enhance marketing efficiency. The focus includes assessing the impact of discounts and regional factors on revenue.

**2. Hypothesis 1:** **Product Category Performance**

**Hypothesis:** Mobiles, Tablets, and Electronics are the top-selling categories.

**Statistical Analysis:** This hypothesis was tested by examining sales data across different product categories to identify the top performers.

**3. Hypothesis 2:** **Discount Impact on Sales**

**Hypothesis:** Orders with discounts have a higher average quantity ordered than orders without discounts.

**Statistical Analysis:** Contrary to the hypothesis, the analysis revealed that discounted orders have a slightly lower average quantity ordered, suggesting minimal impact of discounts on the quantity ordered.
